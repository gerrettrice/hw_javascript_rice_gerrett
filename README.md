# Comments

I had to reach out to Kelly Marton on Friday night regarding the last JavaScript
requirement. I couldn't figure out how to account for the display parameter in
the inception function. She told me she had to use another function to accomplish
the log. I also kept getting an error in the developer tools on line 22, which
contained only the code mentioned in the instructions. This particular part was
very frustrating and confusing as I wasn't sure how to remedy the problem.
